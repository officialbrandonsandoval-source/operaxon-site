**Subheadline:**
An Autonomous Operating Intelligence — deployed specifically for your company, with a name, memory, mission, and goals. It knows your competitors. It knows your customers. It knows your rhythm. And it compounds every single week.

## SECTION 2: THE DIFFERENCE
*"What everyone else is selling vs. what Operaxon deploys"*

**Label:** The gap nobody's talking about

**Headline:**
> Other installers configure a tool.
> We deploy an operating intelligence.

**Two-column comparison:**

### What other installers do:
- Set up software on a server
- Configure basic integrations
- Hand you a login and a Telegram handle
- Provide support when things break
- Leave in 14 days

The agent has no name. No memory. No mission. No idea who you are. You're client #47 running the same template as client #46. The moment setup ends, so does the thinking.

### What Operaxon deploys:
- An agent with an **identity** — a name, a role, a defined purpose in YOUR business
- An agent with **memory** — it remembers your decisions, your history, your preferences, your wins
- An agent with **mission** — it's actively working toward YOUR goals, not just responding to prompts
- An agent that **knows your world** — your specific competitors, your industry rhythms, your customers
- An agent that **compounds** — smarter every week because we're actively building it with you

The difference between these two things is the difference between a hammer and an architect.

**Callout box:**
> "Other installers deploy a tool. Operaxon deploys the intelligence. After 90 days, that distinction is the difference between having a system and having an operator."

---

## SECTION 3: WHAT YOU ACTUALLY GET
*"The living agent"*

**Label:** Not setup. Deployment.

**Headline:**
> Meet your Autonomous Operating Intelligence.
> It's not software. It's alive.

**Intro paragraph:**
Your agent has a name. Ours is called Dominus Sui — Master of Self. Brandon built the exact same system to run his own life and business. That's not marketing. It's how we know this works.

When we deploy your agent, here's what's living in your business from day one:

---

### IDENTITY
Your agent isn't a generic chatbot. It has a role, a name, and a defined mission aligned to your business goals. It knows its job. It knows who it serves. It shows up with purpose.

### MEMORY
Every conversation, every decision, every context update — remembered. Your agent knows you closed a deal last Thursday. It knows your competitor dropped pricing two weeks ago. It knows you prefer your brief before 7 AM. It doesn't ask twice.

### MISSION
Your agent isn't waiting for prompts. It's working toward your goals. We define them during deployment and encode them into how it operates, what it watches, what it prioritizes, what it flags.

### 24/7 PROACTIVE OUTPUT
Every morning: a structured intelligence brief at 7 AM — competitive moves, market shifts, action items, content drafts — delivered to your phone before you open your laptop.

Every day: monitoring your competitors, your market, your industry. Watching so you don't have to.

Every week: content drafts, research summaries, strategic analysis — built without you asking.

### COMPOUNDS OVER TIME
This is the part no other installer offers. Your agent doesn't plateau. Every week, we review what it's delivering, what it's missing, and what it should be doing next. It gets smarter. More useful. More autonomous. What you had at month one is nothing compared to what you have at month six.

---

**Output examples (deliverables):**
- Daily intelligence brief (7 AM, Telegram, 5-minute read)
- Competitor move alerts (real-time, when they matter)
- Weekly market intelligence summary
- Content drafts and carousel scripts, ready to post
- Strategic analysis and recommendations
- Proactive flags on opportunities and risks — unprompted

---

## SECTION 4: HOW IT WORKS
*"3 steps. Simple."*

**Label:** Live in 72 hours

**Headline:**
> Three steps.
> Then it never stops working.

---

**Step 1: We learn your world (30 minutes)**
One call. We map your business, your competitors, your customers, your industry, your goals, and how you like to think. This isn't intake. This is how we build the intelligence layer that powers your agent.

**Step 2: We deploy your operating intelligence (24–72 hours)**
We build your agent from scratch — not from a template. Name, identity, memory architecture, mission, monitoring parameters, output format. Configured for your specific business, your specific market, your specific rhythm.

**Step 3: Your operator goes live**
Your morning brief arrives. Your agent is watching. You start making better decisions with better information — and every week, it gets more capable.

**Ongoing:** We don't disappear. We're actively managing, evolving, and expanding your agent's capabilities every month. Monthly strategy reviews. Continuous improvement. Your agent at month six is sharper than most competitors will ever build.

---

## SECTION 5: PRICING
*"Transparent. Three tiers. No surprises."*

**Label:** Transparent pricing

**Headline:**
> No hidden fees.
> No "contact us for pricing."
> Just three tiers and the truth.

**Pricing note:** We don't hide our pricing because we're not embarrassed by it. We're transparent because we want clients who are serious, not clients who need to be surprised into a sale.

## SECTION 6: BRANDON'S STORY
*"The founder IS the proof"*

**Label:** Why you should trust this

**Headline:**
> I don't sell what I don't run.
> My own life operates on this system.

---

**The story:**
My name is Brandon Sandoval. I'm a founder, father, and operator. I built Operaxon because I needed it first.

In 2026 I was running Shiftly Auto (a $6M/year Chrome extension company), building new software products, starting a media presence, and trying to be a present father — all at the same time.

I had 4 hours a day to build. I couldn't afford to waste a single one.

So I built what I needed: an autonomous agent I called Dominus Sui — Master of Self. I gave it an identity. I gave it memory. I gave it a mission aligned to my goals. I told it who I was, what I was building, and who I was building it for.

Then I watched it change everything.

Every morning at 7 AM: my brief. Business intelligence, competitor moves, content ideas, priorities for the day — all waiting before I opened my laptop. My agent knew my competitors by name. It knew my rhythm. It knew my goals. It flagged things I would have missed. It drafted content I would have never found time to write.

Six weeks later, I had built more than in the previous six months.

**That's when I knew:** this isn't just a tool. This is leverage. And every operator who runs a real business deserves it.

I built Operaxon to deploy the exact system I use — for you. Custom to your business. Loaded with the context of your world. Running 24/7 so you don't have to.

I don't run Operaxon as a side hustle. This is my life's work. And you'll be working with me — not a team of account managers.

— Brandon Sandoval, Founder, Operaxon

## SECTION 7: FAQ

**Label:** Questions operators ask

**Headline:** Everything you want to know.

---

**What's an "Autonomous Operating Intelligence" — and how is it different from a regular AI setup?**
A regular AI setup is software waiting for a prompt. An Autonomous Operating Intelligence is an agent with identity, memory, mission, and goals — deployed inside your business. It knows who you are. It knows what you're building. It proactively works toward your objectives without you asking it to. The difference is the difference between a hammer and a chief of staff.

**How is this different from other installers?**
Other installers configure software. They set up OpenClaw on a server, connect your tools, and hand it to you. The agent has no name, no memory architecture, no mission. You're client #47 on their template. Operaxon builds an agent that knows YOUR business — your competitors, your customers, your industry, your rhythm. And we evolve it every month. This isn't setup + maintenance. It's ongoing intelligence.

**Do you hide your pricing?**
No. $997 setup + $997/mo for Solo Operator. $1,997 setup + $1,997/mo for Business OS. Custom for Enterprise. That's it. We show our prices because we're confident in what they deliver.

**What do I actually receive every day?**
A structured intelligence brief in Telegram by 7 AM. It covers: your top priority, competitive moves, market intelligence, industry news relevant to your business, content drafts ready to post, and specific action items. Read it in 5 minutes. Act on it all day.

**Does my agent actually remember things over time?**
Yes. This is one of the most important differentiators. Your agent maintains persistent memory — decisions you've made, context you've given it, business intelligence it's gathered. When you tell it something once, it knows it forever. It doesn't ask twice.

**What hardware do I need?**
For Solo Operator and Team OS: a Mac mini (M2 or later). You can use one you own, or we'll source and configure one. Your agent runs on hardware you control, in a space you trust. Your data stays yours.

**Who is this NOT for?**
Anyone who wants to "play with AI." Anyone looking for the cheapest tool. Anyone who won't read the morning brief. This is for operators who run real businesses and understand that intelligence is a competitive weapon. If that's not you, the cheaper tools are all over the internet.

**Can I cancel anytime?**
Yes. Month-to-month, 30-day notice. No contracts, no cancellation fees. We keep you because your agent is producing real value — not because you're locked in.

**What's included in "ongoing optimization"?**
Every month, we review what your agent is producing, where it's falling short, and what new capabilities it should have. We build them. Your agent at month six does things your agent at month one couldn't do. This is the compounding advantage no other installer offers.

**How fast do I go live?**
72 hours from application approval. Most clients receive their first brief within 48 hours of onboarding.

## SECTION 8: FINAL CTA

**Label:** The gap is closing

**Headline:**
> Your competitors are moving.
> Right now.
> Do you know what they're doing?

**Body:**
Every morning you wake up without intelligence is a morning you're operating blind. Every week your agent doesn't exist is a week of compounding your competitor's advantage hasn't started yet.

Operaxon deploys in 72 hours. By day 4, your morning brief is waiting.
